🙋‍♂️I am Valentín, a focused, dedicated Full Stack Developer. I'm passionate about solving problems, learning new technologies and mastering the ones I already know: JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML5, CSS, NodeJs, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL as a database. Currently adding Typescript to the list and I hope to continue my roadmap to Solidity development.🚀

These last months at Henry coding bootcamp, in addition to the technical knownledge, I developed an infinite number of soft skills, such as teamwork, ability to adapt to constant change, empathy and above all, a continuous and accelerated learning.👨‍💻💪
